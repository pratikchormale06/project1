            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
            <p>Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. Essential cybersecurity practices include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network security</li>
                <li>Application security</li>
                <li>Information security</li>
                <li>Operational security</li>
                <li>Disaster recovery and business continuity</li>
                <li>End-user education</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Penetration Testing</h2>
            <p>Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is the practice of testing a computer system, network or web application to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. Penetration testing can be automated with software applications or performed manually.</p>
            <p>The main objectives of penetration testing include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determining the feasibility of a particular set of attack vectors</li>
                <li>Identifying high-risk vulnerabilities resulting from a combination of lower-risk vulnerabilities exploited in a particular sequence</li>
                <li>Identifying vulnerabilities that may be difficult or impossible to detect with automated network or application vulnerability scanning software</li>
                <li>Assessing the magnitude of potential business and operational impacts of successful attacks</li>
                <li>Testing the ability of network defenders to successfully detect and respond to attacks</li>
                <li>Providing evidence to support increased investments in security personnel and technology</li>
            </ul>
